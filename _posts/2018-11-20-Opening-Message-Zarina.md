I'm not sure exactly what this site will grow into. I am more curious if I can keep improving the navigation, reading, and general feeling of my site. The content is honestly, for the beginning, just thoughts. Ideas, opinions, as I am sure most writers start with. I will move to politics, my favorite passtime, soon. I want to speak with many people about this, especially fellow Americans. I look forward to future discussions, thank you for reading this stupid post.
